    <h1>The Commute Game Plan: "Soletra" Edition</h1>

    <p>Every day, I take an Uber to work. My commute usually takes between 45 minutes and 1 hour and 15 minutes — it all depends on traffic.</p>

    <p>To distract myself from the long commute, I start my day playing <strong>Soletra</strong>, a Brazilian version of <em>Spelling Bee</em>. The problem? I live in <strong>São Paulo</strong>, one of the Brazilian cities with the <strong>highest rates of cellphone theft</strong>.</p>

    <p>Many of these crimes occur during traffic jams, when motorcyclists take advantage of the congestion to break car windows and steal from drivers stuck in traffic.</p>

            The route starts in a <span style="color: #7dbc82;"><b>green zone</b></span>, where I feel relatively safe playing <em>Soletra</em>. Even though the risk is still present, it's the part of the commute where I’m most relaxed.<br><br>
            As I move along, I pass through several stretches marked in <span style="color: #ffb54b;"><b>yellow</b></span>. These are caution zones — I stay alert, especially when traffic slows down or comes to a stop, as those moments can quickly become dangerous.<br><br>
            At certain points, I enter areas highlighted in <span style="color: #fb6a63;"><b>red</b></span>. These are absolute no-go zones for taking out my phone. The risk of being robbed here is simply too high.
