    <h1>The Commute Game Plan: "Soletra" Edition</h1>

    <p>Every day, I take an Uber to work. My commute usually takes between 45 minutes and 1 hour and 15 minutes — it all depends on traffic.</p>

    <p>To distract myself from the long commute, I start my day playing <strong>Soletra</strong>, a Brazilian version of <em>Spelling Bee</em>. The problem? I live in <strong>São Paulo</strong>, one of the Brazilian cities with the <strong>highest rates of cellphone theft</strong>.</p>

    <p>Many of these crimes occur during traffic jams, when motorcyclists take advantage of the congestion to break car windows and steal from drivers stuck in traffic.</p>
